## Share Profile

The user profile can be shared from the `Messages` page. When a user shares their profile on social media, the link of user profile URL e.g `example.com/johndoe` or `johndoe.example.com` get shared, so that when someone clicks on that post on Social media, they can be redirected directly to the user profile page and from where they can send message or post comment.
