# Questions

This is one of the most interesting features of Anofie Pro. Sometimes you want to know what people think about you in some specific areas. That's where the `Questions` comes in. Users can ask questions from the people around. Questions can be added from the `Messages page` by clicking on `Add Questions`.

## Status

To be more specific about a question, users can also write the Question's status while adding a question. It's like adding a guess about the type of response to expect.

## Hide/Show

If a user deletes a Question, it can never be restored and all the comments/answers on the Questions will be deleted. So, we've added soft delete option as `Hide/Show`. When a user `Hide` the question, it won't be available to the public. And if in case, the user changes their mind, they can change the status to `Show` and the question will be available again to the public.

## Pinned Questions
