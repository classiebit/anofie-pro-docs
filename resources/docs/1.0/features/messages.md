# Messages

Send messages anonymously from the user's profile `example.com/johndoe` or `johndoe.example.com`. Anofie is an anonymous messaging system, your identity won't be exposed.

<br>
In the same way, when you receive a message, you can't see the Sender's identity. That's how Anofie works. Anofie is about sending & receiving messages without exposing identities even if you're a registered user.

## Background Frame

Send a message with a background frame. Users can choose among multiple background frames from the user profile page. And the receiver will see the message with the same background frame.
