# Comments

In Anofie, comments are like answers to the questions. You can post a comment on any question. The Commenter identity is always visible to the one who is asking the question. You can see all the `Received` and `Sent` comments on the `Messages` page from the `Received - Comments` and `Sent - Comments` tabs.
