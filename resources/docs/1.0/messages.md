# Messages

You can send message from the user's profile `anofie.com/johndoe` or `johndoe.anofie.com`. Anofie is an anonymous messaging system, your identity won't be exposed to whom you're sending.

<br>
In same way, when you receive a message, you can't see the senders identity. That's how Anofie works. Anofie is about sending and receiving messages from your co-workers, friends and any of your closed ones and without exposing their identities.

> {primary} Anofie is even more than that, keep reading documentation till end üôèüèª
