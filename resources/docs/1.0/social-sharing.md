## Share Profile

You can share your profile from the `Messages` page. When you share your profile, on the social media, the link of your profile URL will be shared, so that when someone click on it, he/she can redirected to your profile page and can send you message or post a comment on one of your question.

## Share Message

You can share a message your received on the social media. If someone sent you message with a background frame, it'll be shared along that background frame.

**We've changed the whole sharing algorithm and logic.**


> {success} And the best part is, you can share the message in any language (yess!!! WE MEAN ANY LANGUAGE).
