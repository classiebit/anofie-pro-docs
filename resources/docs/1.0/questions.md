# Questions

This is another interesting feature of Anofie. Sometimes you wanna know what people think about you in some specific areas. That's where the `Questions` comes in. 

<br>

You can ask questions from the world around you. You can `Add Questions` on the `Messages page` and can see all your questions in the `Questions` tab.

## Status

To be more specific about your question, you can also write `What's is going on in your mind` at the time of adding question or you can write any guesses about the response you expect from the people.

## Hide/Show

If you delete the question, you can never get it back and also you loose all the comments you receive on that question. So for this problem, we have added soft delete option as `Hide/Show`. When you `Hide` the question, it won't be available to the people. And if in case you change your mind, you can `Show` and will get available to people again.

## Pinned Questions

### Pinned: Public questions

Public questions means, when someone post a comment, the comment will be visible to everyone. Everyone can see all the comments of the public questions. And also you, as a question creator, can also post comment on your own questions.

**This is called as multi-directional commenting**


### Un-Pinned: Private questions

Private questions means, when someone post a comment, the comment will be only visible to `You & Commenter` only. And when you post a comment on your own question, it won't be visible to anyone until you make the question Public. 

**This is called as uni-directional commenting**
